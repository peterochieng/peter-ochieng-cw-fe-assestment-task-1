## Changes Made

### Overall Structure

1. Component Organization
   - Issue: Found some weirdly named components (BoxArea97, BoxArea108) that made the code hard to follow
   - Fix: Gave them proper names that actually describe what they do (HeroSection, SearchBar)
   - Reason: Makes the code way easier to understand when you come back to it later

2. TypeScript Implementation
   - Issue: Props weren't typed at all, which was a recipe for bugs
   - Fix: Created proper interfaces for component props
   - Reason: Catches type errors early and makes the IDE actually useful with autocomplete

### Header Component

1. Layout and Styling
   - Issue: Header was completely off from the design specs
   - Fix: Fixed padding (40px sides, 12px top/bottom), set proper height (65px), and added the bottom border
   - Reason: Had to match the design or the UX team would kill me

2. Search Input
   - Issue: Search input looked nothing like the mockup and wasn't accessible
   - Fix: 
     - Resized it properly (160px width, 40px height)
     - Fixed border radius (12px) and padding (16px sides, 8px top/bottom)
     - Made sure the search icon was properly aligned and colored (#9EABB8)
   - Reason: Making it look right and work for everyone

3. Avatar Component
   - Issue: Avatar was tiny and spacing was wrong
   - Fix: Sized it correctly (40px x 40px) and fixed that awkward 32px gap
   - Reason: Details matter for a polished UI

### Hero Section

1. Background and Overlay
   - Issue: The overlay was basically non-existent
   - Fix: Added that subtle gradient overlay that actually makes the text readable
   - Reason: Text was getting lost in the background

2. Title Typography
   - Issue: Text looked anemic compared to the mockup
   - Fix: Bumped up the weight to bold and fixed that 32px bottom margin
   - Reason: Typography is the backbone of good design, can't skimp on it

3. Search Input
   - Issue: Search input was just wrong in every way
   - Fix:
     - Got the dimensions right (480px width, 64px height, 8px radius)
     - Fixed padding (15px sides, 7px top/bottom)
     - Used the right colors (#1C2126 bg, #3D4754 border)
     - Made the search button 48px tall, 96px wide with 7px spacing on right
   - Reason: Had to nail the details for this central component

### Tag Lists

1. Styling
   - Issue: Those pill buttons looked completely off
   - Fix: 
     - Fixed padding (16px sides, 7px top/bottom)
     - Changed text to that muted #9EABB8 color
     - Added proper background and hover states that actually give feedback
   - Reason: Little UI details that make it feel polished

2. Accessibility
   - Issue: No semantic structure or ARIA - screen readers would be lost
   - Fix: Added proper headings and ARIA labels that actually make sense
   - Reason: Everyone should be able to use this app, not just sighted users

3. Responsiveness
   - Issue: Layout broke on mobile - classic oversight
   - Fix: Added responsive adjustments with that useMobile hook
   - Reason: Can't ship something that looks terrible on half the devices out there

### Code Quality Improvements

1. Form Handling
   - Issue: Search fired on EVERY keystroke - performance nightmare!
   - Fix: Added proper form submission so it only searches when you actually want it to
   - Reason: Nobody wants a laggy UI that's constantly making network calls

2. Component Structure
   - Issue: Components were doing way too many things at once
   - Fix: Split things up properly so each component has one job
   - Reason: Makes it way easier to debug and maintain when something inevitably breaks

3. CSS Approach
   - Issue: Styling was all over the place with no consistency
   - Fix: Used Tailwind with specific color values to match the design exactly
   - Reason: Easier for the next dev to understand, and no more "why does it look different on Chrome?"

4. Profile Image
   - Issue: Wrong profile image being used
   - Fix: Updated to use the correct userprofile.png
   - Reason: Can't have random profile pics in production!
